_2.0.7_

- Clean state NPM dependencies / karma
- CoffeeScript 1.10 compatibility
- Make graph visualizer take raw properties
- Add raw graph example (`graph.html`)

_2.0.6_

- Remove unnecessary \_i_o suffix from inout registers.
- Append programmatic defines to bound snippet.\_original
- Make return argument first instead of last output
- Improved auto-connection logic, always match hints first

_2.0.5_

- Fix graph not being returned with material in case of automatic tail block.

_2.0.4_

- Ensure correct ordering of snippet callbacks in all cases

- Allow multiple open 'return' and 'callback' outlets in one graph
- Simplify .isolate() / .callback() interactions

- `.pipe()` and `.require()` now accept a `defines` argument, a hash of symbols to `#define` ad-hoc in GLSL.
